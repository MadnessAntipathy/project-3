# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
ruby '2.6.3'

* Database creation
Need to create and migrate the database, and seed the database.

* Problem statement
Restaurants need an all-in-one solution to have a smooth experience for both the customers and the staff, both front of house and kitchen.

* Technologies Used
Used Ruby on Rails and Ajax to ensure that all content on the pages are up to date. Styled the pages using bootstrap.

* General Approach
After the team has agreed on the idea for the project, the pressing step was to identify the areas of development and how we want to present each function of the app. The team went through a design phase, listing down the flow from when a staff logs in, presenting the customer with options, and closing the table to view the reports. Each phase allowed us to concentrate on the respective areas and from there, we came up with the skeleton of the app.
The team went full stack on each phase of the project, dividing the tasks among each member. It was critical that each member developed their part of the app that allowed for seamless integration when the time came to put the app together. Daily check-ins were performed to see that each member's challenges in the implementation of the task received full support from the other members.

* User Stories
Our users would be the staff and customers at a caf√©/restaurant. For a better experience for both customers and staff, ensuring that orders do not get lost, or the wrong order entered into the system by staff who take down the orders.

* Major Hurdles and Unsolved Problems
Table relations and how to establish the relationship between them.

* Wireframes
Wireframes can be found in the wireframes folder.
